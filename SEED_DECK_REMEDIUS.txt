## Remedius Pre-Screening System: Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Recruitment

**Transforming Patient Identification with AI**

---

### The Challenge: A Bottleneck in Medical Advancement

*   **Slow Recruitment:** Identifying eligible patients for clinical trials is a major bottleneck, often taking months and delaying critical research.
*   **High Costs:** Manual screening is labor-intensive and expensive. Estimates suggest ~80% of trials fail to meet enrollment timelines, and ~50% of sites under-enroll. Each day a blockbuster drug is delayed can cost up to $8 million in lost revenue.
*   **High Failure Rates:** A significant percentage of pre-screened patients are ultimately found ineligible, wasting resources and time.
*   **Data Overload:** Researchers struggle to efficiently process complex patient data and numerous eligibility criteria.

### Our Solution: Remedius Pre-Screening System

An AI-powered platform that intelligently analyzes patient medical data against complex clinical trial protocols.

*   **Automated Analysis:** Leverages advanced AI (like Gemini 2.5 Pro & Claude 4 Opus) to rapidly process patient records.
*   **Accurate Matching:** Precisely matches patients to inclusion/exclusion criteria, including nuanced conditions like TRD.
*   **Dynamic Reporting:** Generates clear, actionable pre-screening reports, including confidence scores and identification of key issues.
*   **Researcher Override:** Empowers investigators with manual override and commenting features, ensuring clinical expertise guides the final decision.

**Remedius: Faster, Smarter, More Efficient Patient Recruitment.**

### Value Proposition: Accelerate Research, Reduce Costs

*   **Drastically Reduce Screening Time:** Cut down patient identification timelines from weeks/months to days/hours.
*   **Significantly Lower Recruitment Costs:** Automate manual tasks, freeing up valuable researcher and clinician time.
*   **Improve Enrolment Quality:** Increase the percentage of eligible patients progressing to full screening.
*   **Enhance Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide comprehensive insights into patient eligibility and potential red flags.
*   **Streamline Workflow:** Integrate seamlessly into existing research processes with user-friendly reports.

**Example:** If a CRO typically spends X hours per patient on manual pre-screening, Remedius can reduce this by an estimated 70-80%.

### How It Works: Intelligent Automation

1.  **Data Input:** Securely ingests anonymized patient medical history and relevant documents.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The system's core AI engine, utilizing models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, analyzes the data against the specific trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria.
3.  **Criteria Matching:** Identifies matches, discrepancies, and areas needing further verification for each criterion.
4.  **Report Generation:** Produces a comprehensive `PrintableReport` with:
    *   Overall qualification assessment.
    *   Estimated probability of qualification (AI initial & post-researcher review).
    *   Breakdown of met/unmet criteria with status indicators and AI rationale.
    *   Space for researcher comments and manual status overrides.
    *   Summaries for TRD analysis, episode estimation, etc.
5.  **Researcher Review:** Clinicians review the AI-generated report, apply their expertise, and make final pre-screening decisions.

### Market Opportunity: A Multi-Billion Dollar Imperative

*   **Global Clinical Trials Market:** Valued at over USD 50 billion (2023) and projected to grow significantly.
*   **Patient Recruitment Market:** A substantial segment, with a critical need for efficiency improvements. Costs associated with patient recruitment can be up to 30-40% of total trial budgets.
*   **Unmet Need:** Existing solutions are often fragmented or lack the sophisticated AI-driven analysis Remedius offers.

**The cost of *not* optimizing recruitment is far greater than the investment in an effective solution.**

### Business Model & Pricing Strategy

**Value-Based Pricing reflecting ROI:**
The average revenue per patient successfully enrolled in a clinical trial can range significantly, from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the trial phase and therapeutic area. Remedius directly impacts this by increasing the speed and success rate of enrollment.

**Proposed Tiers (Illustrative - Requires Market Validation):**

*   **Tier 1: Per-Screening Fee:**
    *   Ideal for smaller institutions or infrequent users.
    *   Example: €50 - €150 per comprehensive patient pre-screening report.
    *   Justification: Significant time saving (e.g., 2-5 hours of expert time saved per patient).
*   **Tier 2: Subscription Model (Volume-Based):**
    *   For CROs and larger research centers with consistent needs.
    *   Small: Up to 100 screenings/month - e.g., €2,000 - €4,000/month
    *   Medium: Up to 500 screenings/month - e.g., €7,500 - €15,000/month
    *   Large/Enterprise: Custom pricing for higher volumes, API access, and premium support.
*   **Tier 3: Value-Sharing/Success-Based (Pilot Phase/Strategic Partnerships):**
    *   A percentage fee based on successfully enrolled patients identified through Remedius.
    *   Higher risk, higher reward; demonstrates confidence in the platform's efficacy.

**Billing Conditions:**
*   Monthly/Annual subscriptions for Tier 2.
*   Pay-as-you-go for Tier 1.
*   Clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for report generation time and support.

**Cost Justification:**
*   If Remedius helps enroll just one extra patient or accelerates a trial by a few weeks, the ROI can be manifold the cost of the service.
*   Reduced administrative overhead, better resource allocation.
